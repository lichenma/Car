# Car Program

A starting python project used to get familiar with writing and running code in Pycharm


## Getting Started

To Run the program, navigate under \venv to find the Car.py file. Then using command prompt or a Python IDE, specify the python interpreter and run the Car.py file. 
On Windows command prompt for example you can run the following: 

```
C:\path to\python.exe C;\path to\venv\Car.py
```


### Prerequisites

A python interpreter is required to run the program ideally the most recent version. For testing I am working with the following version

```
Python Version 3.7
```
